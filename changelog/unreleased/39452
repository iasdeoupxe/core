Enhancement: Expiration date limits for re-share of a received share

With this change, if a user re-shares an existent share with an expiration date,
the expiration date of the target share will be taken for the new share,
if the user doesn't provide an expiration date.

If the expiration date is provided and exceeds the date of the target share,
an error will be thrown.
